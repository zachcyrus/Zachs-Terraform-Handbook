# Zach's Terraform Bible

## Purpose

This repository is meant to host the helpful terraform scripts I use to create my aws infrastructures for various projects. Will update as I find more interesting/helpful scripts.

```
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply - var "instance_name= "
$ terraform apply -destroy
```
