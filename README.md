# Zach's AWS Terraform Handbook

## Purpose

This repository is meant to host the helpful terraform modules I use to create my AWS infrastructures for various projects. Will update as I make and find more interesting/helpful scripts.
The examples directory host different examples on how to use the modules from the modules directory.
